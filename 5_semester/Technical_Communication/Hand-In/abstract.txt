Abstract:

Dyslexia screening in adults is an open challenge since difficulties may not align with standardized tests designed for children. 
We collect eye-tracking data from natural reading of Danish texts from readers with dyslexia while closely following the experimental design of a corpus of readers without dyslexia. 
To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to classify dyslexia from eye movements during reading in Danish. 
We experiment with various machine-learning methods, and our best model yields a 0.85 macro F1 score.

Introduction: 
Dyslexia screening in adults is an open challenge

Background: 
We collect eye-tracking data from natural reading of Danish texts from readers with dyslexia while closely following the experimental design of a corpus of readers without dyslexia. 

General Problem:
since difficulties may not align with standardized tests designed for children. 

Main Result: 
We experiment with various machine-learning methods, and our best model yields a 0.85 macro F1 score.

Discussion:
<empty>

General Context: 
To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to classify dyslexia from eye movements during reading in Danish.

Discussion:

The abstract is in general well-written but cut to the bone. 
It only consists of four concise sentences describing the motivation, experimental setup and the final result, but does not go in depth with main takeaways or discussion points for the result. 
It does not follow the nature template, but opens up with specifying a field challenge and ending on the main result. 
The abstract could benefit from including discussion of the results and a general context in terms of specifying the impact of their research for society. 
We would improve this abstract by rearranging the sentences and adding some more in-depth take-home messages.
